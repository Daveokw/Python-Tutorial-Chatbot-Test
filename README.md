W3Schools Python Chatbot is a question-answering system built with Python, Streamlit, FAISS, and sentence-transformers. It scrapes and embeds knowledge from websites (e.g., W3Schools), stores the data in vector indexes (index.faiss, index.pkl, chunks.pkl), and allows users to query the knowledge base through a conversational interface. The app supports local builds as well as cloud deployment, with prebuilt indexes hosted on storage (e.g., Google Drive) for fast loading.
